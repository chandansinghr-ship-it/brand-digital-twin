//                             every route except the override path.
//   - `overridePool` /
//     `overrideDb`          : carve-out, 4 connections, used ONLY by
//                             `/delivery/dispatch/override`. Even
//                             when the main pool is fully saturated
//                             by background dispatch work, the
//                             override path always has connections
//                             available.
//
// The two budgets sum to 20, well under typical Postgres connection
// limits. The carve-out is intentionally small — override traffic is
// human-driven and bursty, not high-throughput.
