**Version:** `[VERSION]` · **Effective:** `[EFFECTIVE DATE]`

These Terms of Service ("**Terms**") are a binding agreement between you and the
organization you represent ("**you**", "**Customer**") and `[LEGAL ENTITY NAME]`,
`[ENTITY TYPE / REG NO.]`, with its registered office at `[REGISTERED ADDRESS]`
("**we**", "**us**", the "**Company**"). They govern your access to and use of the
Brand Digital Twin platform and related services (the "**Service**"). By creating an
account, clicking "I agree", or using the Service, you accept these Terms. If you do
not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. The Service

The Service ingests metrics from advertising platforms (e.g. Google Ads, Meta) and
commerce and accounting sources (e.g. Shopify, Tally, Zoho Books, QuickBooks, Xero)
that you connect, computes **Profit on Ad Spend (POAS)** and related diagnostics,
surfaces recommendations, and — where you authorize it — can take actions on your
connected advertising accounts within the limits described in Section 4.

**POAS and all outputs are decision-support, not financial, accounting, tax, or
investment advice.** Outputs depend on the completeness and accuracy of the data you
connect (for example, cost-of-goods data drives POAS; where costs are incomplete the
Service marks outputs as estimated or directional). You remain responsible for your
business decisions.

## 2. Accounts, eligibility, and security

2.1 You must be at least 18 and authorized to bind the organization you register.
2.2 You are responsible for the accuracy of registration information, for all
activity under your account, and for keeping credentials secure. Notify us promptly
at `[CONTACT EMAIL]` of any unauthorized use.
2.3 During the beta/private phases, access may be limited to invited or allow-listed
organizations. We may grant, limit, or revoke access at our discretion during these
phases.

## 3. Connected platforms and your authorizations

3.1 To use core features you connect third-party accounts via OAuth. You represent
that you are authorized to connect each account and to grant us the access required
to operate the Service.
3.2 Your use of each connected platform remains governed by **that platform's own
terms and policies** (including Google Ads and Meta advertising policies and Shopify's
terms). You must not use the Service in any way that violates them.
3.3 We access connected platforms only to provide the Service. We store access and
refresh tokens in an encrypted credential vault and revoke them on disconnection or
account deletion (see the Privacy Policy and DPA).

## 4. Autonomous and assisted actions (Trust Tiers)

4.1 The Service operates a graduated autonomy model. You set a **Trust Tier** that
governs what the Service may do without per-action approval:

- **OBSERVE** — monitors only; takes no actions.
- **REVIEW** — proposes actions; every action requires your approval.
- **ASSISTED** — may execute small, capped fixes; escalates the rest for approval.
- **AUTONOMOUS** — may act within a configured daily spend cap; escalates outliers.
- **C-SUITE** — full autonomy within the policies and caps you configure.

4.2 **Authorization.** By raising the Trust Tier and/or setting spend caps, you
expressly authorize the Service to take the corresponding actions on your connected
accounts on your behalf. A tier may not be raised above the level the account has
earned under our governance model; you may lower it at any time.
4.3 **Limits and governance.** Per-action and per-day spend caps are enforced by the
Service. Actions that would exceed your caps are queued for approval rather than
executed. You can review, approve, reverse, and audit actions in the Service.
4.4 **Your responsibility.** Within the limits you configure, actions taken by the
Service are deemed taken by you. You are responsible for the configuration you choose.
We are not liable for outcomes of actions taken within your authorized configuration,
except to the extent of our obligations under Section 9 and applicable law.

## 5. Acceptable use

You agree not to: (a) use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any
connected platform's policies; (b) attempt to access another customer's data or
breach tenant isolation; (c) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Service
without our prior written consent; (d) reverse engineer, resell, or build a competing
service from the Service except as permitted by law; (e) upload unlawful, infringing,
or malicious content; or (f) exceed rate limits or otherwise impair the Service.

## 6. Fees, trial, and "suggest-an-amount" billing

6.1 **Trial.** New accounts may include a free trial of `[trial length]` days. No
payment method is required to begin the trial.
6.2 **Suggest-an-amount.** At the end of the trial we recap the value the Service
surfaced for you and invite you to **name a recurring monthly amount**. The amounts
shown are reference points only, not tiers. Your account remains fully live while
your suggested amount is **pending our review**.
6.3 **Approval and first charge.** A suggested amount becomes effective only after we
approve it. On approval we charge the agreed amount to your payment method and the
subscription becomes active. Thereafter the amount recurs monthly until cancelled.
6.4 **Payment processing.** Payments are processed by a third-party processor
(Razorpay in India; a card processor for other markets). Card details are tokenized
by the processor; **we do not store full card numbers.** Your use of payment features
is also subject to the processor's terms.
6.5 **Failed payments and suspension.** If a charge fails we may retry per our dunning
schedule and, after the grace period, suspend autonomous actions and/or the account
until payment succeeds.
6.6 **Taxes.** Fees are exclusive of taxes; you are responsible for applicable taxes
other than taxes on our income.
6.7 **Changes to fees.** We will give reasonable notice of changes to recurring fees;
continued use after the change takes effect constitutes acceptance.

## 7. Your data

You retain all rights in the data you connect or upload ("**Customer Data**"). You
grant us a limited license to process Customer Data solely to provide and improve the
Service and as described in the Privacy Policy and DPA. Our processing of personal
data is governed by the **Privacy Policy** and, where applicable, the **Data
Processing Addendum**, which are incorporated by reference.

## 8. Intellectual property

The Service, including all software, models, and content we provide (excluding
Customer Data), is owned by us or our licensors and protected by law. We grant you a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to use the Service during your
subscription, subject to these Terms. Feedback you provide may be used by us without
restriction.

## 9. Disclaimers and limitation of liability

9.1 **As-is.** Except as expressly stated, the Service is provided "as is" and "as
available" without warranties of any kind, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
We do not warrant that outputs (including POAS) are error-free or that the Service
will be uninterrupted.
9.2 **No professional advice.** Outputs are decision-support only and not financial,
tax, legal, or accounting advice.
9.3 **Limitation.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither party is liable
for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or lost
profits or revenues. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to the Service
will not exceed the fees you paid to us in the `[12]` months preceding the event
giving rise to the claim. *(Counsel: confirm cap, carve-outs, and consumer-law limits
for `[PRIMARY MARKET]`.)*

## 10. Indemnification

You will defend and indemnify us against third-party claims arising from your Customer
Data, your use of the Service in violation of these Terms or applicable law, or your
configuration of autonomous actions, except to the extent caused by our breach.
*(Counsel: confirm mutuality and scope.)*

## 11. Term, suspension, and termination

11.1 These Terms apply while you use the Service. You may cancel at any time; cancellation
stops future charges and, at your election, begins account deletion.
11.2 We may suspend or terminate access for breach, non-payment, legal risk, or as
required by a connected platform or law, with notice where practicable.
11.3 On termination we delete or anonymize Customer Data per the Privacy Policy and
DPA (`[RETENTION — POST-TERMINATION]`). You may export your data before deletion using
the in-product export.

## 12. Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms. For material changes we will provide notice and may require
you to re-accept before continued use; the Service enforces re-acceptance on a version
change. The current version and effective date are shown on this page.

## 13. Governing law and disputes

These Terms are governed by `[GOVERNING LAW]`, without regard to conflict-of-laws
rules. The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts described there.
*(Counsel: insert/confirm any arbitration clause and seat `[ARBITRATION SEAT]`, and any
market-specific consumer protections.)*

## 14. General

These Terms, with the Privacy Policy and DPA, are the entire agreement on this subject.
If a provision is unenforceable, the rest remains in effect. We may assign these Terms
in connection with a merger or sale; you may not assign without our consent. No waiver
is implied by delay. Notices to us: `[CONTACT EMAIL]`.
